# Civil 3D – Roadway Design and Terrain Modeling (Self Project)

This project demonstrates the end-to-end roadway design workflow using Autodesk Civil 3D.

## Project Scope
- Developed terrain models from survey data with contour generation and surface creation.
- Designed horizontal alignment and vertical profiles.
- Conducted cut-and-fill analysis to evaluate earthwork requirements.
- Generated roadway corridor, longitudinal profiles, and sectional drawings.

## Files
- `Civil3D_self_project.dwg` – Main Civil 3D design file.
- `Civil3D_self_project.pdf` – Exported drawings (alignment, profiles, cross-sections).
- `Civil3D_self_project.dxf` – Interoperable version for other CAD tools.

## Tools Used
- Autodesk Civil 3D (2022)
- AutoCAD

## Applications
The workflow replicates real-world highway and roadway design processes, including geometric design, earthwork analysis, and surface modeling.
